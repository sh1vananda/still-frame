## Reflections in Orbit

In *Solaris*, Tarkovsky turns the science fiction genre inward, crafting a deeply introspective and metaphysical work that interrogates the limits of human understanding. Adapted from Stanisław Lem’s novel, the film is less concerned with futuristic spectacle and more with the emotional and existential weight of memory, guilt, and love.

Psychologist Kris Kelvin is sent to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris, where the crew has succumbed to emotional breakdowns. He quickly discovers that Solaris manifests physical representations of the crew's suppressed memories—his own appearing in the form of Hari, his deceased wife. The planet becomes a mirror, forcing each character to confront their inner lives.

> "We don’t want other worlds; we want a mirror." — *Solaris*

The film is hypnotic in its pacing, layered in texture, and rich with long, meditative sequences that challenge the viewer to slow down and absorb. Solaris’ oceanic surface, ever shifting and unknowable, becomes a stand-in for the subconscious—a vast, alien intelligence that offers neither hostility nor comfort.

*Solaris* doesn’t provide answers. Instead, it offers space to contemplate the mysteries of being, and the impossibility of truly knowing another—or even oneself.
